## The data
The data set is available here:

http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

We downloaded the 'ratings only' data file for Cell Phones and Cell Phone Accessories. We then used the code in the code folder to transform it. Specifically, the file is _convert_data.py_. Unfortunately, the raw data set is too large to store in GitHub, so we cannot put it there. Hence you must download it from the ucsd website yourself.
